Lab 6 - Encrypted Image (Challenge Lab)

ACTIVITY DETAILS

Description
OK everyone seems to be getting all my flags so I've decided to convert this one into a bitmap and then encrypt it with AES using ECB so eh good luck trying to decrypt this one. 

Haha someone has already tried to decrypt it using the wrong key, which resulted in the mess attached. Give up! I've used full strength AES. 

Your time would be better spent on one of the other challenges.  See the attached aes.bmp and try and unscramble the image.

BMP: aes.bmp.enc

LAB 6 ENCRYPTED IMAGE (CHALLENEG LAB) HINTS

The hint says to remove the header file and replace it. The header of a BMP file is present from 00 to 0D. i.e., the first 14 bytes. The first 2 bytes contain the characters ‘BM’, which says that it is a bitmap file. The next 4 bytes specify the file size, the next 4 are reserved, unused and the last 4 bytes are offset from the beginning of the file to the beginning of the bitmap data.

Decryption Methodology:
•
Code Logic:
o Process binary file and divided the binary data into blocks of size 16 bytes
o Created a list called palette containing 256 random RGB colors.
o Created a mapping of unique blocks to color indices
o Mapped each block to its corresponding color.
o Created a new RGB image and populated it with the color data

• Tools and Libraries used:
o Python with PyCryptodome library for AES decryption
o Image handling with Python Imaging Library(PIL)
